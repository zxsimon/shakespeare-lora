Most vegetables and herbs need at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.\n- **Soil Quality:** Test your soil for pH and nutrients.

Choose What to Grow**\n- **Start Simple:** Begin with easy-to-grow plants like tomatoes, lettuce, herbs (basil, mint, parsley), and beans.\n- **Consider Climate:** Choose plants that are suitable for your local climate and growing season.\n- **Space-Saving Options:** Use vertical space with trellises, hanging planters, or containers for vining plants like cucumbers or peas.\n- **Companion Planting:** Some plants grow better together (e.g., tomatoes and basil), which can help deter pests and improve growth.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **3.

Plan Your Garden Layout**\n- **Sketch a Plan:** Draw a rough layout of your garden, noting where each plant will go.\n- **Group Plants by Needs:** Place plants with similar water and sunlight requirements together.\n- **Use Companion Plants:** Group compatible plants to promote growth and reduce pests.\n- **Leave Space for Growth:** Give each plant enough room to grow without overcrowding.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f **5.

The town had been built with almost perfect grid patterns. This impressive feat in city planning would have been impossible without the knowledge of an advanced understanding of geometry. Also it would not have been possible for the Pompeiians to have utilised the technology to design their waste management systems and to ensure that the streets were paved.\n\nThese systems were a testament to the ingenuity of the ancient Pompeiians, who utilised their advanced knowledge of engineering and water supply systems in constructing their city. The town's planning was not solely focused on functionality, but was also designed to be aesthetically pleasing. The architecture of the city was designed to be appealing, with large public buildings which would have helped contribute to this. However, it was also discovered through excavations that each home was uniquely decorated. The presence of artworks such as mosaics in each house would indicate a level of wealth in the town.\n\nThe people of Pompeii were a long way ahead of their time in terms of city planning. The town of Pompeii would have been one of the most advanced in the ancient world prior to its destruction. The people who built this city showed an advanced understanding of engineering concepts and were able to utilise these concepts in the building of their town.", "response": "Lo, Pompeii, that ancient town of wondrous art,  \nDidst boast a grid most perfect, carved by hand of skill,  \nAnd in its veins, the water's coursing, waste's due course,  \nAll by the wisdom of geometry, most wondrous, well applied.  \nForsooth, 'twas not mere stone, but mind that shaped the streets,  \nAnd in their walls, the mosaics sang of wealth and pride,  \nEach home, a gem, with art that didst proclaim the folk were rich,  \nAnd public halls, adorned with grace, didst make the city fair to see.  \nMarry, 'twas not mere function, but beauty, too, that they didst build,  \nAnd in their planning, both the useful and the fair were made.  \nO'er all, the people of Pompeii, long ere their doom,  \nDidst build a town most wondrous, far surpassing all that came before."}
